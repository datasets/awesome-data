Method of calculation:\n\n* Since 1 April 1968, calculated from the daily morning fixing;\n* From January 1950 to 21 March 1954, calculated using the Bank of England's gold purchasing price (1 ounce of fine = pound 12.40) in connection with the average exchange rate for the pound in New York (up to the end of 1952; source: Federal Reserve Bulletin) and, from January 1953, midpoint exchange rates for the US dollar in London (source: Financial Times (FT)).\n* From 22 March 1954 to December 1959, calculated using the fixing price for gold bars of approx. 12 1/2 kg and 995/1000 fineness and over (so-called standard bars) according to data from Metallgesellschaft AG, Frankfurt am Main, in connection with the average midpoint exchange rates for the US dollar in London (source: FT).\n* From January 1960 to 14 March 1968, average fixing price for standard bars as specified in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin.\n* On 15 March 1968, fixing price suspended. Gold market split into an official (reserved for central banks) and a free market as a result of the Washington Communique of 17 March 1968. Gold trading suspended from 18 to 29 March 1968.\n* Sources for daily prices: April 1968 - March 1974: FT; April 1974 - December 1980: Samuel Montagu & Co.

The S&P 500 (Standard and Poor's 500) is a\nfree-float, capitalization-weighted index of the top 500 publicly listed stocks\nin the US (top 500 by market cap).\n\n## Data\n\nThe data provided here is a tidied and CSV'd version of that collected and\nprepared by the Economist Robert Shiller and made [available on his\nwebsite][shiller].\n\n[shiller]: http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm\n\n### Source Data Construction\n\nDetails of the data construction as described on Shiller's website (and\nslightly reformatted):\n\n> Stock market data used in my book, Irrational Exuberance [Princeton University Press 2000, Broadway Books 2001, 2nd ed., 2005] are available for download, Excel file (xls). This data set consists of monthly stock price, dividends, and earnings data and the consumer price index (to allow conversion to real values), all starting January 1871.\n> \n> The price, dividend, and earnings series are from the same sources as described in Chapter 26 of my earlier book (Market Volatility [Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1989]), although now I use monthly data, rather than annual data. Monthly dividend and earnings data are computed from the S&P four-quarter totals for the quarter since 1926, with linear interpolation to monthly figures. Dividend and earnings data before 1926 are from Cowles and associates (Common Stock Indexes, 2nd ed. [Bloomington, Ind.: Principia Press, 1939]), interpolated from annual data.\n>\n> Stock price data are monthly averages of daily closing prices through January 2000, the last month available as this book goes to press. The CPI-U (Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers) published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics begins in 1913; for years before 1913 1 spliced to the CPI Warren and Pearson's price index, by multiplying it by the ratio of the indexes in January 1913. December 1999 and January 2000 values for the CPI-U are extrapolated. See George F. Warren and Frank A. Pearson, Gold and Prices (New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1935). Data are from their Table 1, pp. 11\u201314.\n>\n> For the Plots, I have multiplied the inflation-corrected series by a constant so that their value in january 2000 equals their nominal value, i.e., so that all prices are effectively in January 2000 dollars.\n\n### Preparation\n\nRun:\n\n    python scripts/data.py\n\n## License\n\nNo exact statement on license of original data but given size and factual\nnature believe one can assume these are public domain (and I, the maintainer,\nexplicitly license under the ODC Public Domain Dedication and License (PDDL)).\n\nThat said, it would be natural to credit Robert Shiller for preparing this\ndataset and kindly making it publicly available.\n\n",
